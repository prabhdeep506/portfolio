                  <b>BOOK SUMMARY  : </b> <br>
                From #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover, a novel about risking everything for
                love—and
                finding your heart somewhere between the truth and lies.

                At age twenty-one, Auburn Reed has already lost everything important to her. In her fight to rebuild
                her
                shattered life, she has her goals in sight and there is no room for mistakes. But when she walks
                into a
                Dallas art studio in search of a job, she doesn’t expect to find a deep attraction to the enigmatic
                artist who works there, Owen Gentry.

                For once, Auburn takes a chance and puts her heart in control, only to discover that Owen is keeping
                a
                major secret from coming out. The magnitude of his past threatens to destroy everything important to
                Auburn, and the only way to get her life back on track is to cut Owen out of it.

                To save their relationship, all Owen needs to do is confess. But in this case, the confession could
                be
                much more destructive than the actual sin.



                Confess has been adapted into a seven-episode series filmed by GO90. Available on:">

            To her surprise, a stranger helps clean her up, and they share a
            moment of intense romantic chemistry. She soon discovers his name
            is Jeremy Crawford, and that he’s married to bestselling author Verity Crawford.
            This author—whom Lowen respects enormously for her meticulous research and well–crafted plots—has been left
            incapacitated by a car accident. Verity is an internationally renowned writer, who is best known for 
            her tactic of writing novels from the perspective of the villain. In a meeting at Pantem Publishing, 
            Jeremy offers Lowen a significant sum to finish Verity’s final series of novels. Lowen’s agent Corey
            encourages her to take the deal, but Lowen is extremely nervous about the prospect. However, she can’t
            refuse the enormous sum the Crawfords propose to pay her. She accepts the offer with some trepidation.
            The narrative then moves to Vermont, the location of the Crawford family home. At Jeremy’s invitation,
            Lowen moves in temporarily to sort through Verity’s office and get a feel for her writing.">

               to read novels but never get round to it' Spectator Books of the YearAt first sight, Ove is
                almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots
                 - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code,

                   But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? 
                   Such unswerving conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication 
                   to making it just so?In the end, you will see, there is something about Ove that is quite irresistible. . .">

     Life for Emma isn’t good. The world knows her as Princess 
     Anya on Dark Castle, but then her character gets the 
    axe—literally. The cherry on top is finding her boyfriend
     in bed with another woman. She needs a break, and sanctuary
    comes in the form of Rosemont, a gorgeous estate in California promising rest and relaxation.
    Then she meets the owner’s equally gorgeous grandson,
     ex–hockey player and current recluse Lucian Osmond,
     and she sees her own pain and yearning reflected in his eyes.
     He’s charming when he wants to be but also secretive
     and gruff, with protective walls as thick as Emma’s
     own. Despite a growing attraction, they avoid each other.
     But then there’s an impromptu nighttime skinny-dip,
     and Lucian’s luscious homemade tarts and cream cakes start arriving at Emma’s door, tempting her to taste life again…
     In trying to stay apart, they only grow closer—and 
     their broken pieces just might fit together and make them whole.

             Belly finds out what comes after falling in love in this follow-up to The Summer I Turned Pretty from the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before (soon to be a major motion picture!), Jenny Han.

             Can summer be truly summer without Cousins Beach?

             It used to be that Belly counted the days until summer, until she was back at Cousins Beach with Conrad and Jeremiah. But not this year. Not after Susannah got sick again and Conrad stopped caring. Everything that was right and good has fallen apart, leaving Belly wishing summer would never come.

             But when Jeremiah calls saying Conrad has disappeared, Belly knows what she must do to make things right again. And it can only happen back at the beach house, the three of them together, the way things used to be. If this summer really and truly is the last summer, it should end the way it started—at Cousins Beach.

                talk together about it . . . what it is about, why you liked it, etc. . . . an easy conversation. While

                your review.</p>
